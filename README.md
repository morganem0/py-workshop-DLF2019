## Practical Python Tools for Metadata Assessment: 55-minute workshop

This repository contains materials for a 55-minute workshop at the 2019 DLF Forum in Tampa, FL. 

This is meant to be a a fun and beginner-friendly introduction to a few useful Python tools, in the context of exploring and manipulating tabular metadata for digital collections. We will focus on a few basic functions of Python's pandas data analysis library for exploring, filtering, reshaping, and merging datasets.

### Jupyter Notebook for Workshop 

This notebook contains all exercises and code for the workshop. 

If you have the Jupyter Notebook software installed on your own computer, you can download the repository and run the notebook locally.   

Alternatively, run the notebook in Binder via the link below. Note that Binder can be slow to load -- 2-8 minutes for the notebook to load after opening this URL could happen!

### Workshop Outline

We will walk through three brief examples with digital collections metadata files. After each example there will be an exercise you can try out on your own. 

| activity | time |
| ------ | ------ |
| Intro/how to use jupyter notebook | 10 mins   |
| Example 1: Explore a dataset|  12 mins | 
| Example 2: Compare a group of metadata files | 12 mins| 
| Example 3: Merge info from separate files  |  12 mins | 
| Wrap-up: review resources, options for installing/running python | 5 mins| 


### Backup options: Static Versions of Notebook 

#### Jupyter Notebook Viewer:
* nbviewer.jupyter.org provides a viewer that renders notebook code and markdown as static HTML page.   
* The static version of the notebook below shows all code executed, so you can read the code and see the outputs.

#### Static versions in repository 
This repository also contains static versions of the notebook: 
* **notebook_markdown/py_workshop.md** : best option for viewing rendered notebook within repository 
* **notebook_exercises/py_workshop.ipynb** : notebook formatting rendering is sometimes weird in gitlab, and often fails in github, but this might also work for direct viewing
