Information van on a Kyiv street	Pedestrians are reading pro-Yushchenko information leaflets taped to the rear window of a minivan parked on a Kyiv street. Several people have orange ribbons tied to their clothes. There are orange ribbons tied to the fence in the background.		Bujak's comment: Revolution needs rapid flow and easy access to information. Everybody needs to know what is happening.  This is a key requirement for the leaders (if they have been already chosen) to be trusted. The organizers of the Orange Revolution realized that and found a very efficient way to inform the citizens. Here you see two mobile information centers established on private cars. They head out to the city every morning. While there, they change their location frequently to get the information to everybody.

Trezubets - the Ukrainian coat of arms	Trezubets is seen among the flags, against the gray winter sky.		This is the Tryzub.   It is the symbol of Ukraine. It should be ubiquitous here on Liberty Square but I see only one.  Intrigued, I ask why?  The Ukrainians explain that it is their national symbol but it is deeply rooted in the Ukrainian nationalism. And that nationalism has bad connotations.  It led to the bloody battles with the Poles and other inhabitants of the Ukraine. That’s why they prefer that the Tryzub is not seen on Liberty Square.  The time of the Solidarity was also in Poland the time of very good relations with national and religious minorities.  It was also a time of openness towards the Russians even though they were, in some sense, an occupying force.  Even today, this openness helps us in the relations with the people of the neighboring countries and in our diplomacy.

Marching towards freedom	Despite the snowy blizzard, protestors are marching towards the Independence Square. They are holding either Yushchenko flags or Ukrainian flags and have orange ribbons attached to their clothing.		This parade was one of the first pictures I saw after arriving in Kiev. In the faces of these people marching through snow and icy air I witnessed determination, calm and strength ready to overcome any obstacle and barrier. I immediately felt the unity of our common destiny, aspirations and hopes. These faces and their expression are close to my heart.   Behind this march stands the decision of each and every one of these people. Just like we did in August 1980 (referring to the Solidarnost movement in Poland), they resolved to leave their homes, their families, their towns and villages and are going to the place where the fate of their country is being determined, where it will be decided who will rule Ukraine and how. These people want to participate in this process.  This is a crucial moment: these people no longer want to be passive observers. Their decision – to go to the Liberty Square – means that they are taking responsibility for the future of their country. They are becoming active citizens. This creates an enormous obligation for the future presidents, prime ministers and ministers. From now on, these citizens will want to be involved in the process of reforms and transformation of their country, to have their say in what should change and how. A president or a prime minister who does not allow the people to participate in the governing process will quickly lose popular support.   This new, hoped-for system of government is perfectly natural. The judges and public prosecutors want to be independent, the universities want to be autonomous, towns and villages want to control their own administration and finances. Therefore, decentralization and delegation of authority should be the first priority of the new, post-revolution government.  We decided to protest also for another reason. We were tired of red tape and costs hampering our activities, such as starting a small business, a foundation or an association. People protesting on the the Liberty Squares around the world are usually aware that in some countries (such as Scandinavian states, Canada or New Zealand) the role of public administration is to serve and help the people. Rather than control and punish, the government agencies encourage, help and explain.  It is possible and necessary to learn from these countries how to change the culture of public institutions so that they work for us rather than against us.

Farmers at the Independence Square	Farmers protesting aggressive policy of privatizing.	White banners read: Уряд негайно у відставку;  Ні терору проти фермерів	Here are the peasants.   They are protesting against the terror that they experience. This is a part of the Ukrainian society that suffered greatly at the hands of the Soviet authorities. Forced collectivization of the farmland led to the famine and death of several million peasants.  Almost everywhere peasants are treated as a symbol of backwardness. Even after the successful revolution the newly established elites cannot see that the culture of peasants is the culture of order and duty. This is a great base for an efficient state with productive economy. It was fully understood by the German businessmen who always were for the full access to the labor market for Polish citizens.
